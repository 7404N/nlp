\section{Introduction}

For our final project, we implemented a recursive neural network part-of-speech tagger based on similar prior work by Socher, Manning and Ng (2010) for building sentence parse trees and work by Collobert and Weston (2011) for their distributed word representations. We wanted to explore natural language processing using neural networks, so we chose a small problem (part-of-speech tagging) which we already had experience with during the third homework assignment and applied these modern techniques in neural network research to the problem.

Recursive neural networks are neural network models that allow for cyclic connections between neurons.
